Cloud computing has proven to be a successful distributed computing
model demostrated by its wide spread industrial adoption. Free open
source Cloud platforms are essential to further drive the
deployment of private and hybrid Cloud computing environments.
OpenStack is free open source software originally released by
Rackspace and NASA, which strives to close the gap in the lack of a
comprehensive Cloud platform with fast development and supported by
both an active community of people and large companies. In this work,
we go through and discuss the steps required to come from bare
hardware to a fully operational multi-node OpenStack installation.
Every step discussion in this paper is implemented in the form of a
separate shell script making it easy to understand the intricate
details of the installation process. The full set of the installation
scripts is reseased under the Apache 2.0 License and is publicly
available online.
