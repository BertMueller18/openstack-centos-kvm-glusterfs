There was a problem when libvirtd could not open char device with the following error message:

15391: error : qemuProcessReadLogOutput:1005 : internal error Process exited while reading console log output: chardev: opening backend "file" failed

And then the following error:

error : qemuProcessReadLogOutput:1005 : internal error Process exited while reading console log output: char device redirected to /dev/pts/3
qemu-kvm: -drive file=/var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000015/disk,if=none,id=drive-virtio-disk0,format=qcow2,cache=none: could not open disk image /var/lib/nova/instances/instance-00000015/disk: Permission denied


Both the problems have been solved, by setting the user and group in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf as follows:

user = "nova"
group = "nova"

And also changing the ownership as follows:

chown -R nova:nova /var/cache/libvirt
chown -R nova:nova /var/run/libvirt
chown -R nova:nova /var/lib/libvirt
