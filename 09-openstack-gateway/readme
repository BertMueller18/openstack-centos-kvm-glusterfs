We are running nova-network on the gateway instead of the controller, since our controller is not running nova-compute. This hasn't worked probably because the network configuration of the controller differs from the one of the compute hosts (different network interfaces are used).

## nova-network problems

When after starting nova-network, it gets stuck on "Attempting to grab file lock "iptables" for method "apply"", the solution is:

rm /var/lib/nova/tmp/nova-iptables.lock
