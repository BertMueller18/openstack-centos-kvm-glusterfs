The rapid growth in demand for computational power driven by modern
service applications combined with the shift to the Cloud computing
model have led to the establishment of large-scale virtualized data
centers. Such data centers consume enormous amounts of electrical
energy resulting in high operating costs and carbon dioxide emissions.
Dynamic consolidation of virtual machines (VMs) using live migration
and switching idle nodes to the sleep mode allow Cloud providers to
optimize resource usage and reduce energy consumption. However, the
obligation of providing high quality of service to customers leads to
the necessity in dealing with the energy-performance trade-off, as
aggressive consolidation may lead to performance degradation. Due to
the variability of workloads experienced by modern applications, the
VM placement should be optimized continuously in an online manner.
